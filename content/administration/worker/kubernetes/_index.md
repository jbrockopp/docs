## Prerequisites

This section provides all required dependencies to install and start the worker with Kubernetes.

### Dependency 1: Kubernetes

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) will be used for downloading the worker and managing the lifecycle of the application.

You can refer to [Kubernetes' official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/) on installing and configuring the service.

### Dependency 2: Redis

[Redis](https://redis.io/) will be used for storing workloads, created by the [server](/docs/administration/server/), that will be run by a worker.

You can refer to [Redis's official documentation](https://redis.io/topics/quickstart/) on installing and configuring the service.

## Installation

This section provides an example of installing the worker with Kubernetes.

This example only shows a subset of all possible configuration options.
